Changelog of lizard-base
========================


1.2 (unreleased)
----------------

- Renamed fixture from base into lizard_base.


1.1 (2010-03-03)
----------------

- Copied as much as possible of the old lizard.base.

- Added doc_root (old lizard had instructions on how to add that to apache,
  lizard-base now includes it as a media/ dir that's automatically handled by
  django-staticfiles).
