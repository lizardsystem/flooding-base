1.5 (2010-03-19)
----------------

- Using RequestContext in several render_to_response() calls to gain the
  benefit of the default context processors.  This way, I could add
  ``{{ STATIC_URL }}`` in a lot of places instead of ``{{ root_url }}``.

----------------

- Renamed fixture from base into lizard_base.


1.1 (2010-03-03)
----------------

- Copied as much as possible of the old lizard.base.

- Added doc_root (old lizard had instructions on how to add that to apache,
  lizard-base now includes it as a media/ dir that's automatically handled by
  django-staticfiles).

- Copied templates from the old lizard root to our own template dir.

- Old lizard.base urls are now prefixed with /service.  Most old lizard root
  urls are now directly in our urls.


1.0 (2010-02-24)
----------------

- Initial library skeleton created by nensskel.
